    "- **Step 4:** Once the perpendicular line is drawn, we can see the data points are equally divided and some points may be near to one centroid and the other points are near to the second centroid. \n",
    "- **Step 5:** The data points which are near to respective centroids will form into two seperate groups as we have two centroids. \n",
    "- **Step 6:** Now, the centroids that we initialized will mostly lie outside the datapoints even though its near to our group. Hence, we will calculate the average of all the datapoints within that particular group and update the centroid value. Now, the centroid will be exactly lie inside our group."

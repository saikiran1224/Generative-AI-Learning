    "Program-aided Language Model (PAL) is a novel approach introduced to enhance the capabilities of Language Models (LMs) in handling complex mathematical calculations. While traditional LMs excel at predicting the next token in a sequence, they often struggle with performing actual mathematical computations during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "PAL leverages a Chain-of-thought approach to tackle intricate reasoning problems. However, there are scenarios where this approach may fall short and fail to provide accurate results. For instance, when faced with a question like \"What is 500/23?\", a standard LM would predict the next token without performing the necessary mathematical calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this limitation, PAL integrates program-like functionalities into the LM architecture. By incorporating elements of programming logic, PAL empowers LMs to execute mathematical operations directly, thereby improving their ability to handle complex mathematical tasks. This innovative approach enhances the LM's capacity to engage in sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications."

    "- ReAct is a framework that combines reasoning with acting. It was designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to dynamically reason, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Step 2 - Acting (Action Planning and Execution):** Based on its reasoning, LLM plans and executes specific actions, such as fetching data from external sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3 - Observing:** LLM observes the results of its actions and uses this information to refine its reasoning and plan its next actions. \n",
    "\n",

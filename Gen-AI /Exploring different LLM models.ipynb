    "LLMs are differntiated based on many aspects. Be it Architecture, Training data and use case, etc. Its very important to chose the right LLM model based on our use case or the project that we are trying to develop. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets see some basic model types based on some use-cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Audio and Speech Recognition\n",
    "We can use Whisper-type models for this purpose. These models helps us to recognize the voice in various different languages which it was trained upon. \n",
    "\n",
    "These models are trained on diverse audio and can perform multi-lingual speech recognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Image Generation\n",
    "Dall-E, Bing Image creator and Midjourney were one of the famous models which can be used for Image creation. DALL-E is an offering by OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Text Generation\n",
    "There are many models available in the market which is capable of producting text as an output. OpenAI's GPT 3.5 to 4.0 is one of the latest model. \n",
    "\n",
    "GPT 4.0 is expensive model and GPT 3.5 comes at good price. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Multi-modality\n",
    "\n",
    "It means the same model is capable of doing multiple tasks. The latest releases of OpenAI models which are capable of combining visual understanding text based.\n"

    "\n",
